# ⬡ Site Safety Intelligent Monitor (SSIM)
### 🧠 Building Safety with Intelligent Eyes  

**SSIM** is an AI-powered, real-time safety monitoring system designed to detect **PPE compliance** and **site hazards** using computer vision and multimodal AI.  

It integrates **YOLOv11** for PPE detection, **Gemini/LLaVA** for hazard reasoning, and a **Streamlit dashboard** for live monitoring — with **Telegram alerts** for real-time notifications of safety violations.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🦺 **YOLOv11 PPE Detection** – Identifies helmets, gloves, vests, shoes, and more.  
- ⚠️ **Violation Tracking** – Detects and logs missing PPE based on customizable time thresholds.  
- 🧠 **VLM Analysis** – Uses **Gemini** or **LLaVA** for detecting environmental and behavioral hazards.  
- 💬 **Telegram Alerts** – Sends instant photo/text alerts to a dedicated Telegram chat.  
- 📊 **Streamlit Dashboard** – Displays live camera feeds, detection results, and real-time activity logs.
